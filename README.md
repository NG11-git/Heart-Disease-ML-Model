# Heart Disease Prediction ML WEB App

* Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models. It demonstrates end‑to‑end ML workflow including:

-Data preprocessing

-Model training and evaluation

-Saving/loading models with joblib

-Deployment via a simple app interface (app.py)

* Features

-Multiple ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine

-Modular preprocessing ( train/test split)

-Model comparison with accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score

-Deployment‑ready app with streamlit 

-Clear documentation and requirements management

* Dataset

-The dataset is based on the UCI Heart Disease dataset, containing patient attributes such as:

-Age, sex, chest pain type

-Resting blood pressure, cholesterol

-Fasting blood sugar, ECG results

-Maximum heart rate, exercise induced angina

-ST depression, slope, number of vessels, thalassemia

* Results

-Logistic Regression: 87% accuracy

-SVM    : 82% accuracy
